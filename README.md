# SecureCorp
A Secure multi-account AWS Architecture with Control tower and shared VPCs

# Project Overview
You're working at a growing company called SecureCorp. They build web apps for healthcare clients, so they handle sensitive data ‚Äî emails, medical reports, and personal info.
SecureCorp is moving everything to the cloud (AWS).

But the CTO says:
‚ÄúWe want security to be built-in, not added later. We must separate our environments, monitor everything, and stay compliant (HIPAA, etc.). Security should scale as we grow.‚Äù
So now YOU are helping to design a secure cloud environment from day one.

# Technologies Used:
- AWS Services: Control Tower, IAM, Organizations, S3, VPC, EC2, Postgres on EC2, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Security Hub, KMS, Route53, RAM, ECR, Lambda, SNS

- Networking: Shared VPCs, Subnet isolation, NAT Gateway

- CI/CD: GitHub Actions or CodePipeline

- Security Concepts: IAM Policies, SCPs, encryption, centralized logging, threat detection

#  Architecture Overview:
You‚Äôll build an AWS multi-account environment structured like this:

üîê 1. Master Account (Organization Root)
AWS Organizations

Control Tower (for governance)

SCPs to restrict capabilities of sub-accounts

Guardrails (mandatory and elective)

üõ°Ô∏è 2. Security Account
Centralized logging (CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, Config)

GuardDuty and Security Hub

SNS Notifications for alerts

Role for security team with read-only access to other accounts

üß™ 3. Dev Account
Developers build/test apps here

Shared VPC accessed via RAM

IAM roles scoped to Dev

Hosts FastAPI app running on EC2 (backend) + Postgres on same EC2 instance

üöÄ 4. Prod Account
Only CI/CD pipelines can deploy

Same app as Dev, deployed via GitHub Actions

Read-only IAM roles for security audits

VPC shared from Network Account

S3 encrypted with KMS

üåê 5. Networking Account
Shared VPCs via RAM

Private and Public Subnets

Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, Route Tables

VPC Peering (if needed between legacy and cloud)
