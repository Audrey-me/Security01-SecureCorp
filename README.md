# SecureCorp
A Secure multi-account AWS Architecture with Control tower and shared VPCs

# Project Overview
You're working at a growing company called SecureCorp. They build web apps for healthcare clients, so they handle sensitive data — emails, medical reports, and personal info.
SecureCorp is moving everything to the cloud (AWS).

But the CTO says:
“We want security to be built-in, not added later. We must separate our environments, monitor everything, and stay compliant (HIPAA, etc.). Security should scale as we grow.”
So now YOU are helping to design a secure cloud environment from day one.
