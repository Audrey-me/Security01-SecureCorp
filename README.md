# SecureCorp
A Secure multi-account AWS Architecture with Control tower and shared VPCs

# Project Overview
You're working at a growing company called SecureCorp. They build web apps for healthcare clients, so they handle sensitive data — emails, medical reports, and personal info.
SecureCorp is moving everything to the cloud (AWS).

But the CTO says:
“We want security to be built-in, not added later. We must separate our environments, monitor everything, and stay compliant (HIPAA, etc.). Security should scale as we grow.”
So now YOU are helping to design a secure cloud environment from day one.

# Technologies Used:
- AWS Services: Control Tower, IAM, Organizations, S3, VPC, EC2, Postgres on EC2, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Security Hub, KMS, Route53, RAM, ECR, Lambda, SNS

# Setup
```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
